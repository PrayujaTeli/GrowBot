# GrowBot
Embarking on Project GrowBot, crafting an interface for an automated garden box. Using live weather data, I'll optimize plant growth. From user-friendly design to seamless integration, every step ensures an innovative gardening solution. Testing and quality assurance to ensure GrowBot's functionality, reliability, and user-friendliness.

## Features

- **Auto-water mechanism:** Implement a system within the garden box that automatically waters the plants based on their specific needs.

- **Auto-shade mechanism:** Develop a mechanism to provide shade to the plants when necessary, utilizing sensors to detect excessive sunlight exposure and deploying a shading system to protect the plants from heat stress.

- **Auto-temperature control:** Integrate a temperature control system to regulate the internal environment of the garden box, ensuring that the temperature remains within the optimal range for plant growth, with the ability to adjust heating or cooling mechanisms as needed.
